=== sessionState

I'm not sure if I can use window.sessionStorage but there's WinJS.Application.sessionState. I wonder if the API is the same.

Here's the API URL in MSDN: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/br211377.aspx

The WinJS.UI section is under Controls heading. There's also Windows.UI.WebUI.

The WinJS.Application doc page times out for me. Here's some other one: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/subscriptions/securedownloads/br229774.aspx

Hmm, not the same API: Any data stored on sessionState will automatically be serialized. Nice!

=== local

But that's session. The map's extent should survive session pauses, no? I think I want WinJS.Application.local which as a similar to web storage API but not the same. Ah, local is an actual, physical file. Going to check HTML5 localStorage instead.

Nice, we do have localStorage. This is friendly!

Hmm, after it closes, the tile is still around. However, at some point I lost my bbox and thus, localStorage ;(

Maybe that was only because I forced a rebuild and the new binary has a different signature.

localStorage doesn't always stay. I'm not sure what's up with that.

I tried Application.local, but I'm getting exceptions even by just calling .exists("bbox");

I may have killed the app before saving.

=== innerHTML

That [object] text was just because I was using toStaticHTML on a jQuery object, existingChildren. Doh! Works great now!

=== suspend/checkpoint

I'm having trouble getting suspend to trigger. It triggers when the user is closing the app. You can't stop termination at that point but you can save data.

=== adding search

Added search via Add New Item. Following this quickstart: http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/Hh465238

onquerysubmitted fires when your app is the main app. It "navigates" to the search results page. It sends search args but I don't know how they're sent to the page yet.

"Alternatively, you can register for the suggestionsrequested event and build your own list of suggestions."

I want to do this but can't find the property: "Use searchPane.showOnKeyboardInput so that the search box receives input when a user types."

The searchData function gets everything. Make sure to check for empty queryText and do something useful.

Hmm, not sure I can get an async result for searchData.

searchData returns a WinJS.Binding.List object. How do I add items one at a time? Maybe .push? It's a bad day for the MS Win8 docs to go down. Yeah, .push! Thank's Intellisence!

Ok, so navigation doesn't work in the blank app template. If you want to use search, you need to start with at least the navigation template. Sheesh!

Also, put the map on the home page, not default.

=== jQuery

jQuery does cause errors but appears to work anyway.

=== web

I can't access web content easily in Windows Store apps.
